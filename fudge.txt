yes, this is a random note i threw in, uhh, but, 2.3 WILL be delayed (like all my other versions) because i lost my removable drive. you might ask "WhY CaNt yoU StORe iT oN YoUr CoMpUtER" its because i have no fucking disk space. you see, i only have 64gb of storage on my laptop (talk about 4 year old devs, not funny)
